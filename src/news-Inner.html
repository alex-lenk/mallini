            <p>Interest in skin care supplements, or beauty foods, has been strong in Asia, and that trend is growing
                fast in Europe as well. These nutrient rich beauty foods make a good case for starting a beauty regime
                from within, one that is designed to prevent or reduce the effects of aging, like sagging skin.</p>

            <p>Some products on the market include a supplement containing lacto-lycopene, vitamin C, and soy
                isoflavones. This is aimed at restoring firmness to the skin for women over 40, and was developed by
                Nestle and L’Oreal. Others have been developed using lycopene and grape seed extract, both antioxidants.
                Grape seed extract also stops enzymatic reactions that lead to collagen in the skin being broken down.
                Antioxidants protect the capillaries in skin and thus ensure that enough nutrients get to the living
                cells that eventually push their way to the surface and become the skin you see in the mirror. </p>

            <p>We’ve come a long way since our mothers straightened our hair with an iron and ironing board, and it has
                never been more evident than now. The Sedu hair straightener has revolutionized the way we straighten
                our hair and has proved that hair Sedu style is hair to be truly envious of.</p>

            <h2>H2 Title</h2>

            <p>Hair Sedu style is identified by sleek, straight, shiny and conditioned tresses, the likes of which can
                only be obtained by using the Sedu ceramic flat iron. This flat iron infuses hair with moisture during
                every step of the straightening process to ensure that hair Sedu style remains healthy, shiny, strong
                and vibrant. The secret of hair Sedu style lies with ionic technology and the materials used to create
                the Sedu hair straightener. Hair Sedu style is achieved thanks to the high concentration of negative
                ions, which work to infuse moisture and shine into the inner layers of your hair. The smooth ceramic
                plates of the Sedu ceramic flat iron also work like no other ordinary straightening iron to give you
                hair that is truly Sedu style. Ceramic tile, made from clay and hardened by fire, is a naturally moist
                and smooth material. When heated, it actually infuses its moisture into any absorbent material that it
                comes into contact with such as your hair.</p>

            <h3>H3 Title</h3>

            <p>The results are luxurious, shiny tresses that can only be credited to the Sedu hair straightener. Not
                only is hair Sedu style a step above styles created with ordinary flat irons, hair Sedu style also
                boasts of tresses that are up to three times smoother and silkier than those that can be achieved with
                other ceramic flat irons. Additionally, the Sedu hair straightener uses ultra-smooth plates which
                guarantees smooth straightening motions that will not pull or break your hair. This all results in truly
                healthy and silky hair Sedu style. Sedu styled hair is also a breeze to achieve and maintain. The Sedu
                flat iron cuts straightening time in half and heats up to the desired temperature in less than 25
                seconds. This means that not only will your hair style be gorgeous, it will also take you a fraction of
                the time to go from frizz to sleek than it does when using conventional flat irons. And the consistent
                heat held by the ceramic plates of the Sedu flat iron means that your hair will be shiny and frizz free
                throughout. From the roots of your hair to the tips of your tresses, your hair will be beautiful when
                you achieve hair Sedu style.</p>
